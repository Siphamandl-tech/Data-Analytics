Business landscape, data analytics is a compelling subject that transcends industry boundaries. Skills such as machine learning, data visualization, and narrative crafting are no longer exclusive to data scientists and analysts. They are becoming increasingly crucial for professionals across diverse sectors, educational backgrounds, and hierarchical levels.

Analytics programs allow businesses to access the untapped value locked within their data. Today, many organizations recognize the potential value of this work but are still in the early stages of developing their analytics programs.
Once data is in a suitable form, data professionals apply analytic techniques to draw conclusions from their data, create visualizations to depict the story of their data, and develop reports and dashboards to effectively communicate the results of their work to business leaders.
